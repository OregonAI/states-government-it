Executive Summary
The following guidelines address procurement, uses, and training related to deploying Generative
Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in California state government. These guidelines provide best practices
and parameters to safely and effectively use this transformative technology to improve services for all
Californians.

The language throughout Governor Newsom’s Executive Order N-12-23 on Generative Artificial
Intelligence (“Executive Order”) emphasizes the need for responsible implementation of GenAI
throughout state government. State entities and their respective leadership will ultimately be
responsible for evaluating and incorporating GenAI to support each entity’s unique structure and
mission. Recognizing this responsibility, the Administration is establishing a framework of required
training and state policy guidance to inform, enable and support state leaders in the ethical,
transparent and trustworthy use of GenAI.

This document builds upon the State of California: Benefits and Risks of Generative Artificial
Intelligence Report published in November 2023 and serves as interim guidance as California seeks to
publish the final procurement and training policy in 2025, after extensive piloting, research and
stakeholder engagement.

The following guidelines provide the necessary information and steps for state leaders to assess
responsibly and accurately – and potentially procure and deploy – GenAI tools in their state entity.
State entities should use these guidelines to meet the Executive Order’s directive that all state
agencies “shall consider pilot projects of GenAI applications” by July 2024.

Before July 1, 2024, there is a soft launch period to test the GenAI risk assessment process that
includes the state entity’s GenAI lead, as well as Chief Information Officer (CIO)/Agency Information
Officer (AIO) consultation with the California Department of Technology (CDT) to help determine a
state entity’s GenAI readiness before proceeding with a GenAI purchase.

Many state entities may be in the early stages of building internal capacity and knowledge to
effectively and responsibly use GenAI tools, while simultaneously seeing software and tools they
already use deploying GenAI-based software updates. Section VI of these guidelines provides
guidance for such incidental GenAI procurements.

For state entities that may be further along in both staffing capacity and knowledge of GenAI, these
guidelines outline the required steps necessary to safely and responsibly procure and deploy new
GenAI technology.

I – Introduction and Background
The state of California Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) guidelines for public-sector
procurement, uses and training is intended for use by state procurement professionals, Chief
Information Officers (CIOs), Agency Information Officers (AIOs), Information Security Officers (ISOs),
legal offices, and other program designees responsible for business analysis leading to the purchase
of goods and services.

Section 3.a of Executive Order N-12-23, signed by Governor Newsom on September 6, 2023,
mandates:

      The Government Operations Agency, the California Department of General Services, the
      California Department of Technology, and the California Cybersecurity Integration Center,
      shall issue general guidelines for public sector procurement, uses, and required trainings for use
      of GenAI, including for high-risk scenarios such as for consequential decisions affecting access
      to essential goods and services.

GenAI has the potential to improve service-delivery outcomes and increase access to and utilization
of government programs. The discussion about how GenAI can be incorporated into the work of
state government is complex and requires robust and thoughtful engagement. Use of GenAI
technology may help streamline existing processes and enhance time spent on more critical work,
leading to better outcomes. Consideration of the use of this new technology must be integrated into
strategic planning efforts, enterprise risk management, and results-oriented management
frameworks. As state entities consider procuring and using GenAI technology, the state will partner
with stakeholders to learn about the advancement of GenAI and navigate the associated risks.

The California Department of General Services (DGS) and California Department of Technology
(CDT) will update guidance as the implementation of GenAI – including pilot cases – is tested and
put into production.

II – Definitions and Example GenAI Use Cases
GenAI has the ability to generate novel text, images and other content, potentially changing how
the state conducts business and serves the public. Terms used in this guidance document include
definitions from the State Administrative Manual (SAM) 4819.2. The definitions will aid in identifying
GenAI technologies and applying GenAI-specific requirements and processes. These definitions are
specific to state administrative use and are not intended to be applied to a broader context.

New definitions for Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology rely on several sources, including The White
House's Blueprint for an Al Bill of Rights (October 2022), and the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) Al Risk Management Framework.
These definitions are subject to change; refer to SAM 4819.2 for current definitions.

   •   Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) – Pretrained AI models that can generate images,
       videos, audio, text, and derived synthetic content. GenAI does this by analyzing the structure
       and characteristics of the input data to generate new, synthetic content similar to the original.
       Decision support, machine learning, natural language processing/translation services,
       computer vision and chatbot technologies or activities support may be related to GenAI, but
       they are not GenAI on their own.

   •   Incidental GenAI purchase – A purchase for which a state entity identifies the use of GenAI
       tools as part of the overall purchase for any type of procurement. A request to primarily
       purchase a good or service, where the state or vendor identifies a subcomponent of the
       purchase as using GenAI tool(s) to assist with the delivery of the solution, is considered an
       incidental purchase of GenAI.

   •   Intentional GenAI purchase – A purchase for which a state entity identifies a GenAI product or
       solution to meet a business need for any type of procurement. A request to purchase a
       specific GenAI product or solution at the onset of a procurement is considered an intentional
       purchase of GenAI.

Definitions for the following terms are available in SAM 4819.2.

   •   Algorithm
   •   Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   •   Automated decision system
   •   Automation
   •   Chatbot
   •   Consequential decision
   •   Large language model
   •   Machine learning
   •   Natural language processing

GenAI is rapidly evolving, and the ways in which the technology can be used are likely to grow well
past the date of these guidelines’ initial publication. The below list serves as an initial set of common
use cases for GenAI tools that may be of interest to use in a state-approved setting. In some of these
use cases, specialized techniques (such as few-shot learning and other technical advancements)
allow high-quality output with minimal data.
GenAI General Guidance                        Page 6 of 16
GovOps/CDT/DGS/ODI/CalHR

State procurement and contracting professionals and program contract managers – working with
their CIOs and AIOs – must diligently identify GenAI before and throughout the procurement process.
Many types of purchases may include elements of GenAI regardless of whether a state entity is
intentionally trying to purchase GenAI or not. A solicitation may receive bid responses that include
GenAI, regardless of whether it is a non-IT goods and services, IT goods and services, or
telecommunications purchase.

State procurement and contracting professionals, program contract managers, and leaders should
be especially attentive to procurements involving deliverables in the areas displayed in the chart
below. As GenAI tools have already been integrated into these tasks in other domains, vendors may
propose a solution that includes GenAI, even if that wasn’t the state entity’s original intent. The
following table provides examples of business needs that may result in a GenAI purchase. Please
note that while these GenAI use cases are common, they may not always be optimal or necessarily
appropriate for a state entity’s programmatic needs or for the Californians they serve. State entities
will need to evaluate the associated risks such as security, privacy, workforce and equity outcomes.
(See Section V—GenAI Risk Assessment and Management, for more information.)

III – Summary of State Entity Responsibilities
Collectively, CDT, DGS, and the California Department of Human Resources (CalHR) are responsible
for providing guidance, support, and training to state entities considering the use and procurement
of GenAI technology. Each state entity is responsible for the ethical, transparent and trustworthy
deployment of GenAI in their organization and must assess the impact to the state workforce. State
entity directors and their executive leadership teams, including their CIOs, are responsible for the
following:

All state entities need to prepare for incidental GenAI purchases. Steps 1-3 must be completed:
   1. Assign a member of the executive team the responsibility of continuous GenAI monitoring and
      evaluation. In most cases, this responsibility should fall to the state entity’s CIO.
   2. Attend mandatory Executive and Procurement Team GenAI trainings. (See Section IV—
      Training for more information.)
   3. Review annual employee training and policy to ensure staff understand and acknowledge
      the acceptable use of GenAI tools. (See Section IV—Training, which describes a framework for
      state government worker training and upskilling. More guidance on training opportunities is
      forthcoming.)
For state entities seeking intentional procurements, items 1-3 above, in addition to items 4-8 below,
must be completed:

   4. Before procuring new GenAI technology, identify a business need and understand the
      implications of using GenAI to solve that problem statement. A comprehensive discovery
      process that includes an assessment of the problem and potential solutions through market
      research will be essential in preprocurement analysis.
   5. Create a culture of engagement and open communication with state employee end users for
      a collaborative and collective approach on the impact of Gen AI technology.
   6. Assess the risks and potential impacts of deploying the GenAI under consideration. Section V
      of this document provides direction on the risk assessment process to assist state entities in
      determining the impact of using GenAI on routine and nonroutine tasks. Future guidance will
      provide a framework for determining the impact of the use of GenAI on Californians,
      particularly vulnerable communities.
   7. Before deploying a solution that includes GenAI into production, the state entity must invest
      time and resources to prepare data inputs and test models adequately. The testing phase will
      allow staff to experiment with the proposed solution, gather feedback, and correct outcomes
      to reduce bias and inaccurate information. Evaluation of the GenAI technology will continue
      throughout its use within a state entity, and will involve a human. (See Section V—GenAI Risk
      Assessment and Management, for more information.)
   8. Establish a GenAI-focused team responsible for continuously evaluating the potential use of
      GenAI and its implications for operations and program administration. The use of GenAI tools
      will in many instances require a “human in the loop” to provide feedback to the model.

   All state entities are required to conduct and submit an inventory of all uses of GenAI – intentional
   and incidental – to the California Department of Technology. Direction will be provided at a later
   date.

IV – Training
State Workforce GenAI Training

Procurement and Risk Assessment GenAI Training will be incorporated into a broader sequence of
forthcoming GenAI trainings pursuant to the Executive Order and in coordination with CalHR.
Subsequent trainings will support the broader state workforce beginning July 31, 2024. The below
roadmap previews future training opportunities.

The GenAI training strategies and recommendations for state staff are designed to accomplish the
following key goals:
          •   Support safe, secure and responsible business implementation of GenAI.
          •   Prepare California’s state government workforce for the next generation of skills
              needed to thrive in the GenAI economy.
          •   Utilize GenAI tools to achieve equitable outcomes and identify and mitigate potential
              output inaccuracies and biases.
When exploring the use of GenAI technology, state entities should consider a phased approach to
workforce training. Three recommended phases are organized by various disciplines to ensure
training goals are met, resulting in effective leadership in using GenAI within the state.

Phase 1: Executive Leadership, Legal, Labor and Privacy
Executive-level individuals should receive general education and training first, followed by more
specialized roles in leadership. This will allow executives to ensure that the appropriate individuals in
their organizations are enrolled in subsequent training. The recommended specialized roles for phase
1 training include legal, labor and privacy specialists so that potential legal, labor and privacy risks
are identified and addressed proactively.

Phase 2: Program Staff and Technical Experts
State entities should build GenAI skill sets and competencies for program staff to identify where
GenAI may help improve operational efficiency and high-quality, equitable service delivery. Program
staff will be trained and prepared to evaluate potential GenAI use cases and identify potential risks.

State entities should train technical experts and cybersecurity professionals concurrently with
program staff to ensure safety and security during use case planning and piloting. Trained technical
experts will also be essential for evaluating a state entity’s technical readiness for GenAI technology
ahead of procurement.

Phase 3: General Workforce
General workforce roles should receive general education and training before GenAI tools are
deployed. Training on emerging technologies will also be available for the statewide workforce who
utilize GenAI technology. Rightsizing the education and training to the business needs of the
workforce and departments will ensure the best use of GenAI to deliver critical services for California.

Procurement GenAI Training

To provide the required training pursuant to Section 3.a of the Executive Order, beginning March 29,
2024, state purchasing officials will have access to Procurement GenAI Training. CIOs/AIOs and
Administration chiefs/deputy directors are also encouraged to take this training. The training will focus
on the following:

   •   Identifying GenAI purchases
   •   Intentional and incidental GenAI purchase process flows

To register for the class, visit the California Procurement and Contracting Academy (CalPCA)).

Additional Support

CDT and DGS will provide ongoing support to state entities through the GenAI community of practice
(AI Community [AIC]), workshops in coordination with CalHR, and specific areas of practice learning
opportunities.

V – GenAI Risk Assessment and Management
Risk management is a key component of responsible deployment and use of GenAI technology.
Deployment of GenAI technologies must be evaluated through a risk assessment based on the
National Institute of Standards and Technology’s AI Risk Management Framework, as well as relevant
portions of the SAM and State Information Management Manual (SIMM). As indicated in Section IV,
training will be provided to state leaders and procurement teams to effectively assess and mitigate
GenAI risk within their state entity.

A state entity’s CIOs must evaluate risk for all GenAI usage and purchases, whether intentional or
incidental.

CDT will continue to develop policies specific to GenAI technologies to reinforce the California
Generative Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Principles, located in the GenAI Toolkit, and will
provide additional guidance to CIOs and AIOs on how to evaluate risks associated with GenAI
acquisitions.

Broad questions that should always be considered before the start of using GenAI include:

   •   What are potential inequities in problem formulation?
   •   What are the data inputs?
   •   How and when will the solution be implemented and integrated into existing and future
       processes and delivery of services?
   •   Who will be the GenAI team responsible within the program area to monitor, validate and
       evaluate the GenAI tool?
   •   How does using the GenAI tool build trust with the end user, including Californians impacted?
   •   Is the GenAI tool accessible and culturally appropriate?
Additional information and resources specific to risk can be found in the GenAI Toolkit – GenAI Risk
Assessment and Management section.

VI – GenAI Procurement
The State Contracting Manual is the primary source of guidance for state contracting and
procurement. Existing contracting laws, policy and procedures are applicable to purchases that
include GenAI. When a state entity is considering intentionally or incidentally purchasing GenAI,
additional measures must be included in the procurement process to properly assess the risk
associated with the GenAI tool or service. This applies to IT, non-IT, or telecommunications purchases.

The following guidelines must be followed when procuring GenAI:

   1. All solicitations must incorporate mandatory GenAI bidder/offer disclosure notification
      language regardless of acquisition type, dollar value or method. See “Mandatory Disclosure
      Language” in the GenAI Toolkit for more information.
   2. A written solicitation is required every time a state entity is purchasing GenAI. Use of acquisition
      methods that do not require a solicitation, such as the Fair and Reasonable Acquisition
      Method, is prohibited when purchasing GenAI.
   3. A risk evaluation is required by the state entity’s CIO/AIO as well as a GenAI consultation with
      CDT. This includes purchasing GenAI technology functions or services using a DGS Leveraged
      Procurement Agreement (LPA). For more information about CDT GenAI consultation, see “CDT
      Consultation” in the GenAI Toolkit.
          •   For IT transactions, the SIMM 71-B form “Certification of Compliance with IT Policies”
              must indicate the use of GenAI technologies.
          •   For non-IT transactions, state entities must implement internal procedures for identifying
              GenAI technologies.
          •   For telecommunications, if identified by the vendor, state entities must include the
              GenAI Disclosure & Fact Sheet in GenAI intake documents.
   4. CDT will provide a “GenAI Assessment” for GenAI procurements. The GenAI Assessment must
      be included in requests to state entity procurement officials as well as to DGS for
      procurement/contract services (e.g., non-IT contract approval, Non-Competitively Bid [NCB]
      justification requests, requests for DGS’ Procurement Division to conduct purchases above
      purchasing authority dollar thresholds, increases in purchasing authority, etc.) and kept in the
      procurement file.
   5. GenAI technology solutions must incorporate GenAI Special Provisions as identified through
      CIO/AIO consultation with CDT regardless of acquisition type, dollar value or method.
   6. For all evaluations/offers submitted, the GenAI Disclosure & Fact Sheet form is required to be
      completed by the bidder/offeror. If GenAI is disclosed by the bidder/offeror, the procurement
      official must engage the state entity’s CIO/AIO before awarding any procurements.
   7. State entities must report contracts that are intended to purchase or use GenAI technologies.
      For more information, see “Reporting” in the GenAI Toolkit.
   8. Contract management for contracts that include the use of GenAI technologies requires
      special attention before accepting or approving deliverables. State entities must assign a
      GenAI subject matter expert to assist with contract management functions. For more
      information regarding GenAI contract management, see “Contract Management of GenAI
      technology” in the GenAI Toolkit.

GovOps/CDT/DGS/ODI/CalHR

   9. Amendments that add new GenAI technology, change the risk level or modify the underlying
      GenAI technology must be resubmitted to CDT for review prior to execution. Routine
      amendments to GenAI contracts for time or money are not required to undergo additional
      CDT consultation.
   10. State entities must consult CDT if a GenAI technology function or service has been added to a
       contract without their consent. This may be identified during a contract amendment process
       or post-award contract management activities.
As GenAI is tested and put into production, DGS and CDT will update procurement guidance
accordingly. For additional details about required steps for GenAI procurement, including visualized
process flows and mandatory contract language, please see the GenAI Toolkit – Procurement
Process for GenAI.
